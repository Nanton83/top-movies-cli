# Top::Movies::Cli

The Top Movies CLI is a command line interface that allows the user to answer very simple questions to get information about the top 100 movies of all time.  The information is scraped from the web address https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000049962/ as well as each individual movies imdb web address.

## Installation

To install this CLI simply type 'cd top-movies-cli' in order to communicate with the correct files.  Once you are in the top-movies-cli directory 'bundle install' and then in the command line type 'ruby top-movies' to begin.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top-movies-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top-movies-cli
